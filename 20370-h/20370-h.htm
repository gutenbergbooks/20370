<h2><a name="AUTHORS_NOTE" id="AUTHORS_NOTE"></a>AUTHOR'S NOTE</h2>


<p>Nearly all the verses that now make their first appearance in book
form are reprinted from <i>Punch</i>, by kind permission of Messrs.
Bradbury and Agnew. The rest I have taken from two little books that
were published in Bombay during my last (and, I suppose, final) tour
of service in India. They contained a good deal of work that was too
local or topical in interest to stand reproduction, and&mdash;especially
the elder, which is out of print&mdash;some that I would sooner bury than
perpetuate. The rest I have overhauled, and included in this
re-collection.</p>

<p>Readers in, or of, India have been kind enough to regard my previous
efforts with favour. I hope that this little volume will find them no
less benevolently disposed, and that at the same time it may not be
without interest to those whose knowledge of the Shiny East is derived
from hearsay.</p>

<span class="i0">In the dim and distant ages, in the half-forgotten days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the East became the fashion and an Indian tour the craze,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As a soldier of distinction and considerable weight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But though weightiness of mind is an invaluable trait,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But he stuck to it, till finally his pressing needs were filled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the mammoth of his species, a Leviathan in build,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And phenomenally qualified to carry twenty stone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the General was happy; for the noble creature showed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thought it time to make a protest, which he did by lying down.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They appealed to him, reproached him, gave him sugar, cut his feed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in vain; for almost daily that inexorable steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he heard his master coming, looked insultingly around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with cool deliberation laid him down upon the ground.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But they fought it out between them, till the undefeated brute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made a humorous obeisance at the General Salute!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then his owner kicked him wildly in the stomach for his pranks,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The clash of stick on stick, the muffled shin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sudden whistle, and the murmurous note<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mutual disaffection. Otherwhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The myriad coolie chortled, knightly palms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clapped, and the whole vale echoed to the noise<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fortune with equal favour poised the scale,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On, and so paddled swiftly in its wake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good ash gleamed and fell; the forward ranks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave passage; once again she smote, again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paddled, nor passed, but paddling ever neared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mournful guardian of the Sacred Goal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hewing and hacking. Little need to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Susan in her glory; whom she smote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She felled, and whom she shocked she overthrew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, shrieking, passed exultant to her doom.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For Susan, while she clove a devious course,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The bold Sir Referee, and shrilled abroad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tremulous, momentary 'touch.' But she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaving with unaccustomed exercise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blinded and baffled, wild with all despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood sweeping, as a churl that sweeps the scythe<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span><span class="i0">In earlier pastures. Twice he skipped, and poured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The desperate whistle. Once again, and he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skipping, diffused the whistle. But at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shrewd a blow she dealt him on the shin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That had he stood reverse-wise on his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not on his feet, I know not what had chanced.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the shuddering Orient skies there rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A marvellous great shriek, the splintering noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of shattered ash-plant and of battered shank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mixed with a higher. For Susan, overwrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lost footing, and with one clear dolorous wail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell headlong, only more so. And I saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed in black stockings, mystic, wonderful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That which I saw. The coolies yelled. The crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closed round, and so the tourney reached an end.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then home they bore the bold Sir Referee<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here, in mine old-time harbourage installed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lulled by the murmurous hum of London's traffic<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that full calm which may be justly called<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Seraphic,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I praise the gods; and vow, for my escape<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the hard grip of premature Jehannun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One golden-tissued bottle of the grape<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Per annum.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For on this day, from Orient toils enlarged,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Kneeling, I kissed the parent soil at Dover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where a huge porter in his orbit charged<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Me over;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Flashed in the train by Shorncliffe's draughty camp;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gazed on the hurrying landscape's pastoral graces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old farms, and happy fields (a trifle damp<br /></span>
<span class="i10">In places);<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Passed the grim suburbs, indigent and bare<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of natural foliage, but bravely flying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frank garlandry of last week's underwear<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Out drying;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so to Town; and with that blessed sight<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I, a poor fevered wreck, forgot to shiver&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgot to mourn the Burden of my White<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Man's Liver;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And felt my bosom heave, my breast expand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With thoughts too sweet, too deep for empty cackle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such thoughts as nothing but a first-class Band<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Could tackle:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Till, from its deeps, my celebrated smile<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(Which friends called Marvel) clove my jaws asunder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lucid, intense, and all men stood awhile<br /></span>
<span class="i10">In wonder!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Let none approach me now, for I have dined;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The fire is bright; Havana's choice aroma<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Infects my being with a pleasant kind<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Of coma;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Calmly I contemplate my future lot:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I reconstruct the past&mdash;it fails to strike me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With aught of horror (pity there are not<br /></span>
<span class="i10">More like me!)&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My bosom's lord sits lightly on my breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The East grows dim; and every hour I stuck to it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imparts a richer brightness to the West,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Good luck to it!<br /></span>
